**ISS Distance Calculator**

**Description:**
	This code calculates the distance in miles between the current position of the International Space Station (ISS) and the user's location. The distance is calculated using the haversine formula, which is a way to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere based on their longitudes and latitudes. To get the current position of the ISS, the code makes a request to the ISS position API and obtains the latitude and longitude from the response. The user's location is determined using the geocoder library, which looks up the user's IP address and returns the latitude and longitude of their location. Finally, the haversine formula is used to calculate the distance between the two points and the result is printed to the console.
